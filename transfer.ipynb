    "# Automating Music Transfers Between YouTube and Spotify\n",

    "Recently, my partner and I decided to rationalize our music subscriptions. She had been using Spotify, and I was on YouTube Music. Spotify's family program looked like it would work perfectly for us, but it meant I would lose all my playlists and favorite songs on YouTube. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, I wanted to transfer my playlists over from YouTube to Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick Google search showed there were a number of tools that could do this, but they all required me to grant quite permissive access to my accounts to a third-party tool that I wasn't completely sure of the provenance of. So, I decided to investigate how hard it would be to do it myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wonderfully, both Spotify and YouTube Music have excellent API access available, and it's pretty straightforward to set up developer-style access to your account. Below are the steps you can take to try this yourself!"
